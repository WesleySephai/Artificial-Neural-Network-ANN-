Dataset : Diabetes.csv

Implement of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow and Keras for  image classification on the Diabetes dataset.

The assignment should include 
following steps: 
● Loading and preprocessing the Diabetes dataset. 
● Defining the architecture of the ANN model, consisting of hidden layers and an 
output layer. 
● Compiling the model with an appropriate loss function, optimizer, and evaluation 
metric. 
● Training the model on the training data. 
● Evaluating the model's performance on the test data.
